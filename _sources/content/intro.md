Py-Feat provides a comprehensive set of tools and models to easily detect facial expressions (Action Units, emotions, facial landmarks) from images and videos, preprocess & analyze facial expression data, and visualize facial expression data. 

## Why you should use Py-Feat
Facial expressions convey rich information about how a person is thinking, feeling, and what they are planning to do. Recent innovations in computer vision algorithms and deep learning algorithms have led to a flurry of models that can be used to extract facial landmarks, Action Units, and emotional facial expressions with great speed and accuracy. However, researchers seeking to use these algorithms or tools such as [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace), [iMotions](https://imotions.com/)-[Affectiva](https://www.affectiva.com/science-resource/affdex-sdk-a-cross-platform-realtime-multi-face-expression-recognition-toolkit/), or [Noldus FaceReacer](https://www.noldus.com/facereader/) may find them difficult to install, use, or too expensive to purchase. It's also difficult to use the latest model or know exactly how good the models are for proprietary tools. **We developed Py-Feat to create a free, open-source, and easy to use tool for working with facial expressions data.**

## Who is it for? 
Py-Feat was created for two primary audiences in mind: 
- **Human behavior researchers**: Extract facial expressions from face images or videos with a simple line of code and analyze your data with Feat. 
- **Computer vision researchers**: Develop & share your latest model to a wide audience of users. 

and anyone else interested in analyzing facial expressions!

## Installation
Install from [pip](https://pypi.org/project/py-feat/)
```
pip install py-feat
```

Install from [source](https://github.com/cosanlab/feat)
```
git clone https://github.com/cosanlab/feat.git
cd feat && python setup.py install
```

You can install it in [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/) or [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/) using the code above. You can also install it in Development Mode:  
```
!git clone https://github.com/cosanlab/feat.git  
!cd feat && pip install -q -r requirements.txt
!cd feat && pip install -q -e . 
!cd feat && python bin/download_models.py
# Click Runtime from top menu and Restart Runtime! 
```

The last development mode installation using the `pip install -e .` can also be useful when contributing to Py-Feat.

## Check installation

Import the Fex class
```python
from feat import Fex
```

Import the Detector class
```python
from feat import Detector
```
